Stationery Management System

This is my third project

Stationery Management System is a web project where organization named HMT Technologies tracking the Stationery request. 
Normally in any institution the request for the stationery is tracked via an e-mail or via excels sheets or registers and this leads to tremendous wastage of resources.
There may be scenarios where the quantity kept in the godown or store of the item may be more than needed and the supply of few items may be less than needed.
This system will help in reducing the wastage at the same time look into generating reports to give a high level view to the higher management for the benefit of the organization
